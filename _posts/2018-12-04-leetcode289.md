# Game of Life

## 題目敘述

According to the [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```
**Follow up:**

1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?


簡單的說，就是把一個盤面的下一局結果算出來，規則是：
> 1. 若此格為live，且周圍活著的鄰居數少於2，則下一回合為dead
> 2. 若此格為live，且周圍活著的鄰居數剛好介於2-3，則下一回合為live
> 3. 若此格為live，且周圍活著的鄰居數多於3，則下一回合為dead
> 4. 若此格為dead，且周圍活著的鄰居數剛好是3，則下一回合為live
  
follow up則是要求in-place運算，以及說明這題目是簡化的，真實的遊戲表示邊界是無邊際的，那麼該如何解決。

## 想法

構想其實蠻單的，喝杯咖啡就解完了
1. 說要in-place就代表要想個辦法同時可以在寫入新值時，也能推回舊值
0 -> 本來是dead 下一局還是dead
1 -> 本來是live 下一局還是live
2 -> 本來是live 下一局是dead
3 -> 本來是dead 下一局是live
(0, 1)不用復原，前後兩局狀態都沒變
(2, 3)%2+1則還原前局結果，(2, 3)%2則為下局結果
2. 就loop through每一個點，照著規則去運算(記得要還原舊值)
3. 全部算完後，在loop through每個點，把(2, 3)表示回正常
   



## 解法

```js
var gameOfLife = function (board) {

  const STATE_DEAD = 0,
    STATE_LIVE = 1,
    STATE_LIVE_TO_DEAD = 2,
    STATE_DEAD_TO_LIVE = 3;
  
  const coorDiff = [
    [-1, -1],
    [-1, 0],
    [-1, 1],
    [0, -1],
    [0, 1],
    [1, -1],
    [1, 0],
    [1, 1],
  ];

  board.forEach((row, i) => {
    board[i].forEach((col, j) => {
      var neighborAliveSum = 0;
      coorDiff.forEach((el, index) => {
        let neighborRow = i + el[0],
          neighborCol = j + el[1];
        if (neighborRow < 0 || neighborCol < 0 || neighborRow > board.length - 1 || neighborCol > board[i].length - 1) {
          //out of range, do nothings
        } 
        //以上一回合的值做加總，所以2, 3需要復原
        else {
          if (board[neighborRow][neighborCol] == STATE_LIVE_TO_DEAD || board[neighborRow][neighborCol] == STATE_DEAD_TO_LIVE)
            neighborAliveSum += (board[neighborRow][neighborCol] + 1) % 2;
          else
            neighborAliveSum += board[neighborRow][neighborCol];
        }
      });

      //依照規則賦值
      if (board[i][j] == 0)
        board[i][j] = (neighborAliveSum == 3) ? STATE_DEAD_TO_LIVE : STATE_DEAD;
      else
        board[i][j] = (neighborAliveSum >= 2 && neighborAliveSum <= 3) ? STATE_LIVE : STATE_LIVE_TO_DEAD;
    });
  });

  //最後改回規定的值
  board.forEach((row, i) => {
    board[i].forEach((col, j) => {
      board[i][j] %= 2;
    });
  });
};
```
